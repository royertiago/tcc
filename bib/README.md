Bibliographical References
==========================

List of useful (or not) bibliographical references.

This folder is currently a subfolder of TCC; I aim to make this a separate
repository, for multiple works.



File Organization
=================
Each bibliographical reference is mantained in a .bib file, containing
all relevant information about the reference, including (if avaliable)
an abstract.

In parent directory there is a 'bibliography.bib', a single file containing
the concatenation of all the references defined within this directory.
